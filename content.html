            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <p class="beginning-p">“What’s the cloud?” “Where is the cloud?” “Are we in the cloud now?!” These are all questions you’ve probably heard or even asked yourself.
              Now new trend in IT is Cloud computing. When we hear that something is "in the cloud", what that's actually referring to is a repository
              (such as large datacenters) where software applications and files are housed and made available through an Internet connection. In other words,
              when you upload a photo to Instagram, you're essentially accessing and storing the photo in a cloud-based service, also know as a SaaS (Software as a Service) model.
              We will discuss more on this top in later section.</p>
            <p>Technically, a computing cloud is a group of servers networked together with the following two characteristics:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>They're accessible over a network such as the Internet.</li>
              <li>They're virtualized, meaning multiple independent operating systems can be run on a server at once.</li>
            </ul>

          <div id="Cloud_Computing">
            <h1>What is Cloud Computing?</h1>
            <p class="beginning-p">Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of compute power, database storage, applications, and other IT resources through a cloud services platform
              via the Internet with pay-as-you-go pricing. Whether you are running applications that share photos to millions of mobile users or you’re supporting
              the critical operations of your business, a cloud services platform provides rapid access to flexible and low-cost IT resources. With cloud computing,
              you don’t need to make large upfront investments in hardware and spend a lot of time on the heavy lifting of managing that hardware. Instead, you can
              provision exactly the right type and size of computing resources you need to power your newest bright idea or operate your IT department. You can access
              as many resources as you need, almost instantly, and only pay for what you use.</p>
              <p>Cloud computing is a model that enables the following features:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Users can provision and release resources on-demand.</li>
                <li>Resources can be scaled up or down automatically, depending on the load.</li>
                <li>Resources are accessible over a network with proper security.</li>
                <li>Cloud service providers can enable a pay-as-you-go model, where customers are charged based on the type of resources and per usage.</li>
              </ul>
          </div>

          <div id="Cloud_Computing_Services">
            <h1>Cloud Computing Services</h1>
            <p class="beginning-p">Cloud computing provides developers and IT departments with the ability to focus on what matters most and avoid undifferentiated work such as procurement,
              maintenance, and capacity planning. As cloud computing has grown in popularity, several different models and deployment strategies have emerged to help meet
              specific needs of different users. Each type of cloud service and deployment method provides you with different levels of control, flexibility, and management.
              Understanding the differences between Infrastructure as a Service, Platform as a Service, and Software as a Service, as well as what deployment strategies you
              can use, can help you decide what set of services is right for your needs.</p>
              <ol>
                <li><strong>Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)</strong></li>
                <p>means you're buying access to raw computing hardware over the Net, such as servers or storage. It typically provides access to networking features,
                  computers (virtual or on dedicated hardware), and data storage space. Since you buy what you need and pay-as-you-go, this is often referred to as utility
                  computing. Ordinary web hosting is a simple example of IaaS: you pay a monthly subscription or a per-megabyte/gigabyte fee to have a hosting company serve
                  up files for your website from their servers.</p>

                <li><strong>Platform as a Service (PaaS)</strong></li>
                <p>means you use a complete application running on someone else's system. It removes the need for your organization to manage the underlying infrastructure
                  (usually hardware and operating systems) and allows you to focus on the deployment and management of your applications. This helps you be more efficient
                  as you don’t need to worry about resource procurement, capacity planning, software maintenance, patching, or any of the other undifferentiated heavy lifting
                  involved in running your application.Web-based email and Google Documents are perhaps the best-known examples.</p>

                <li><strong>Software as a Service (SaaS)</strong></li>
                <p>means you develop applications using Web-based tools so they run on systems software and hardware provided by another company. It provides you with a completed product
                  that is run and managed by the service provider. In most cases, people referring to Software as a Service are referring to end-user applications. With a SaaS offering you
                  do not have to think about how the service is maintained or how the underlying infrastructure is managed; you only need to think about how you will use that particular
                  piece of software. A common example of a SaaS application is web-based email which you can use to send and receive email without having to manage feature additions to
                  the email product or maintain the servers and operating systems that the email program is running on.</p>
              </ol>

          <div id="Cloud_Deployment_Models">
            <h1>Cloud Computing Deployment Models</h1>
            <p class="beginning-p">Cloud computing deployment models are based on location. In order to know which deployment model would best suit your organization requirements,
              it is necessary to know the four deployment types.</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Public Cloud</strong>, is a type of hosting which cloud services are delivered over a network for public use. Customers do not have any control over the location
                of the infrastructure. The cost is shared by all users, and are either free or in the form of a license policy like pay per user. Public clouds are great for organizations
                that require managing the host application and the various applications users use.</li>
              <li><strong>Private Cloud</strong>,  is a cloud infrastructure that is solely used by one organization. It gives organizations greater control over security and data which is
                safeguarded by a firewall and managed internally. It can be hosted internally or externally. Private clouds are great for organizations that have high security demands, high
                management demands and uptime requirements.</li>
              <li><strong>Hybrid Cloud</strong>, uses both private and public clouds, but can remain separate entities. Resources are managed and can be provided either internally or by external providers.
                A hybrid cloud is great for scalability, flexibility and security. An example of this is an organization can use public cloud to interact with customers, while keeping their data secured
                through a private cloud.</li>
              <li><strong>Community Cloud</strong>, is an infrastructure that is mutually shared between organizations that belong to a particular community. The community members generally share similar privacy,
                performance and security concerns. An example of this is a community cloud at banks, government in a country, or trading firms. A community cloud can be managed and hosted internally or by a third
                party provider. A community cloud is good for organizations that work on joint ventures that need centralized cloud computing ability for managing, building and executing their projects.</li>
            </ul>
