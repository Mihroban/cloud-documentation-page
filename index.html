                <p class="beginning-p">“What’s the cloud?” “Where is the cloud?” “Are we in the cloud now?!” These are all questions you’ve probably heard or even asked yourself.
                  Now new trend in IT is Cloud computing. When we hear that something is "in the cloud", what that's actually referring to is a repository
                  (such as large datacenters) where software applications and files are housed and made available through an Internet connection. In other words,
                  when you upload a photo to Instagram, you're essentially accessing and storing the photo in a cloud-based service, also know as a SaaS (Software as a Service) model.
                  We will discuss more on this top in later section.</p>
                <p>Technically, a computing cloud is a group of servers networked together with the following two characteristics:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>They're accessible over a network such as the Internet.</li>
                  <li>They're virtualized, meaning multiple independent operating systems can be run on a server at once.</li>
                </ul>

                <header class="title">What is Cloud Computing</header>
                <p class="beginning-p">Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of compute power, database storage, applications, and other IT resources through a cloud services platform
                  via the Internet with pay-as-you-go pricing. Whether you are running applications that share photos to millions of mobile users or you’re supporting
                  the critical operations of your business, a cloud services platform provides rapid access to flexible and low-cost IT resources. With cloud computing,
                  you don’t need to make large upfront investments in hardware and spend a lot of time on the heavy lifting of managing that hardware. Instead, you can
                  provision exactly the right type and size of computing resources you need to power your newest bright idea or operate your IT department. You can access
                  as many resources as you need, almost instantly, and only pay for what you use.</p>
                  <p>Cloud computing is a model that enables the following features:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Users can provision and release resources on-demand.</li>
                    <li>Resources can be scaled up or down automatically, depending on the load.</li>
                    <li>Resources are accessible over a network with proper security.</li>
                    <li>Cloud service providers can enable a pay-as-you-go model, where customers are charged based on the type of resources and per usage.</li>
                  </ul>

            <section class="main-section" id="Cloud_Computing_Services">
                <header class="title">Cloud Computing Services</header>
                <p class="beginning-p">Cloud computing provides developers and IT departments with the ability to focus on what matters most and avoid undifferentiated work such as procurement,
                  maintenance, and capacity planning. As cloud computing has grown in popularity, several different models and deployment strategies have emerged to help meet
                  specific needs of different users. Each type of cloud service and deployment method provides you with different levels of control, flexibility, and management.
                  Understanding the differences between Infrastructure as a Service, Platform as a Service, and Software as a Service, as well as what deployment strategies you
                  can use, can help you decide what set of services is right for your needs.</p>
                  <ol>
                    <li><strong>Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)</strong></li>
                    <p>means you're buying access to raw computing hardware over the Net, such as servers or storage. It typically provides access to networking features,
                      computers (virtual or on dedicated hardware), and data storage space. Since you buy what you need and pay-as-you-go, this is often referred to as utility
                      computing. Ordinary web hosting is a simple example of IaaS: you pay a monthly subscription or a per-megabyte/gigabyte fee to have a hosting company serve
                      up files for your website from their servers.</p>

                    <li><strong>Platform as a Service (PaaS)</strong></li>
                    <p>means you use a complete application running on someone else's system. It removes the need for your organization to manage the underlying infrastructure
                      (usually hardware and operating systems) and allows you to focus on the deployment and management of your applications. This helps you be more efficient
                      as you don’t need to worry about resource procurement, capacity planning, software maintenance, patching, or any of the other undifferentiated heavy lifting
                      involved in running your application.Web-based email and Google Documents are perhaps the best-known examples.</p>

                    <li><strong>Software as a Service (SaaS)</strong></li>
                    <p>means you develop applications using Web-based tools so they run on systems software and hardware provided by another company. It provides you with a completed product
                      that is run and managed by the service provider. In most cases, people referring to Software as a Service are referring to end-user applications. With a SaaS offering you
                      do not have to think about how the service is maintained or how the underlying infrastructure is managed; you only need to think about how you will use that particular
                      piece of software. A common example of a SaaS application is web-based email which you can use to send and receive email without having to manage feature additions to
                      the email product or maintain the servers and operating systems that the email program is running on.</p>

                <header class="title">Cloud Deployment Models</header>
                <p class="beginning-p">Cloud computing deployment models are based on location. In order to know which deployment model would best suit your organization requirements,
                  it is necessary to know the four deployment types.</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Public Cloud</strong>, is a type of hosting which cloud services are delivered over a network for public use. Customers do not have any control over the location
                    of the infrastructure. The cost is shared by all users, and are either free or in the form of a license policy like pay per user. Public clouds are great for organizations
                    that require managing the host application and the various applications users use.</li>
                  <li><strong>Private Cloud</strong>,  is a cloud infrastructure that is solely used by one organization. It gives organizations greater control over security and data which is
                    safeguarded by a firewall and managed internally. It can be hosted internally or externally. Private clouds are great for organizations that have high security demands, high
                    management demands and uptime requirements.</li>
                  <li><strong>Hybrid Cloud</strong>, uses both private and public clouds, but can remain separate entities. Resources are managed and can be provided either internally or by external providers.
                    A hybrid cloud is great for scalability, flexibility and security. An example of this is an organization can use public cloud to interact with customers, while keeping their data secured
                    through a private cloud.</li>
                  <li><strong>Community Cloud</strong>, is an infrastructure that is mutually shared between organizations that belong to a particular community. The community members generally share similar privacy,
                    performance and security concerns. An example of this is a community cloud at banks, government in a country, or trading firms. A community cloud can be managed and hosted internally or by a third
                    party provider. A community cloud is good for organizations that work on joint ventures that need centralized cloud computing ability for managing, building and executing their projects.</li>
                </ul>

                <p class="beginning-p">Amazon Web Services (AWS) is Amazon’s cloud web hosting platform that offers flexible, reliable, scalable, easy-to-use, and cost-effective solutions. If you want to make the most of the AWS cloud, then,
                  Amazon EC2 and Amazon S3 are both important services to understand. </p>
                <p>Amazon Web Services offers a broad set of global cloud-based products including compute, storage, databases, analytics, networking, mobile, developer tools, management tools, IoT, security and enterprise applications.
                  In below section, we will learn about AWS computer services(Like EC2) and AWS Storage Services(Like S3). </p>
            </section>

            <section class="main-section" id="Amazon_EC2">
                <header class="title">Amazon EC2</header>
                <p class="beginning-p">Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) is a web service for launching and managing server instances in Amazon's data centers. You can use Amazon EC2 server instances at any time, for as long as you need,
                  and for any legal purpose. Instances are available in different sizes and configurations.</p>
                <p>The Amazon EC2 simple web service interface allows you to obtain and configure capacity with minimal friction. It provides you with complete control of your computing resources and lets you run on Amazon’s
                  proven computing environment. Amazon EC2 reduces the time required to obtain and boot new server instances (called Amazon EC2 instances) to minutes, allowing you to quickly scale capacity, both up and
                  down, as your computing requirements change. Amazon EC2 changes the economics of computing by allowing you to pay only for capacity that you actually use. Amazon EC2 provides developers and system
                  administrators the tools to build failure resilient applications and isolate themselves from common failure scenarios.</p>

              <h4 class="text-warning">Delete an Empty Bucket</h4>
              <p>Before you can delete an Amazon S3 bucket, you must ensure that the bucket is empty or an error will result. If you have a versioned bucket, you must also delete any versioned objects associated with the bucket.
              (Please Check the link for more details on <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/v1/developer-guide/examples-s3-buckets.html">Removing Objects from an Unversioned/Versioned Bucket Before Deleting It</a>) </p>
              <p>Once you remove the objects from a bucket (including any versioned objects), you can delete the bucket itself by using the AmazonS3 client's deleteBucket method.</p>
